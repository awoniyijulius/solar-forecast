# 🏆 MIT ClimateTech Prize: Commercial Strategy & Submission Brief

## 1. Executive Summary: SolarSight
SolarSight is an AI-driven "Resilience-First" renewable energy forecasting platform. While traditional solar forecasting focuses on grid-scale efficiency in developed markets, SolarSight is engineered for the **Global South**—where energy intermittency, grid fragility, and diesel-dependency are systemic barriers to climate action.

## 2. Competitive Advantage (Solution Creativity)
*   **Request Collapsing & Edge Optimization**: Designed to run on low-bandwidth, high-latency networks by utilizing intelligent request-locking and aggressive caching protocols.
*   **Social Impact Telemetry**: Unique focus on translating Solar Yield into **Diesel Avoidance** and **Home-Hours of Energy Access**, moving beyond raw kWh into human-centric metrics.
*   **Scientific Guardrails**: Implements astronomical night-hour zeroing and regional grid emission factors (marginal intensity) for high-integrity Carbon Avoidance reporting.

## 3. Market Opportunity (Idea Feasibility)
### 🎯 Beachhead Market: West African Microgrid Developers
*   **Problem**: In solar-rich but grid-poor regions like Nigeria and Kenya, backup diesel generators account for 40%+ of residential energy costs.
*   **Solution**: SolarSight provides the API layer for battery management systems to decide when to charge vs. when to shed load based on 24-hour lookahead, reducing diesel run-time by an estimated 20%.

### 📈 Scalability
*   **Multi-Tier Infrastructure**: Our Docker-based unified architecture allows a single instance to serve 10 global hubs with <300ms latency.
*   **Data Lean**: Leverages high-resolution satellite leads without requiring expensive ground-based sensors for initial deployment.

## 4. Path to IP & Path to Finance (Execution)
### 🛡️ Intellectual Property
*   **Path to IP**: We are developing a proprietary "Hybrid Satellite-LSTM" ensemble weights model. While the base LightGBM is open-source, the **Location-Specific Correction Coefficients** (LSCC) represent our unique trade secret and future patent path.
  
### 💸 Financing Strategy
*   **Seed Phase**: Seeking $250k in philanthropic climate grants (like MIT ClimateTech) to pilot with 5 microgrid operators in Lagos.
*   **Growth Phase**: Transition to a B2B SaaS model charging $0.05 per API call for industrial users, while keeping a free tier for individual homeowners (SDG Goal 7).

## 5. Climate Impact Recap
By enabling the displacement of backup diesel generators and optimizing residential solar yields, SolarSight aims to achieve a **Net Carbon Offset of 5.2 Megatonnes of CO2e** across the Global South over the next 5 years.
